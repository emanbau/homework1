What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge keeps the history of your changes, and allows for changes from one branch to get safely merged into another branch through a merge commit. This maintains the history of both branches while keeping the context of the two.
A rebase will take the beginning history of one branch, and attach it to the tip of another branches head. This creates a lineaar history, but doesn't maintain the history of the two branches as separate, but rather together.
